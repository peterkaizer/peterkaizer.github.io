At ten years old, I sited down in front of an IBM computer for the first time just playing with MS-DOS, creating directories, copy and delete files, fun stuffâ€¦ a few years later, my father got another computer with Windows NT. I got amazed by the display of the windows and the color of the executable files (paintbrush, sound recorder, solitary, mines, word, excel, etc.).  Also, of course, I started playing video games that came in 5.25" floppy disk at first and them 3.5" floppy drive, I enjoyed the installation process, and I was curious of how the programs built and how was the communication between hardware and software (programming)â€¦ My first favorites video games were Prince of Persia, Maniac Mansion, Leisure Suit Larry, Digger, Sim city, Test Drive, the secret of Monkey Island, and the list can go until today's date GTAVâ€¦ 

I always liked to open and took apart the computers and reassembled them again. On my 15th, I used to make "clones PC" and sold it by phone request pickup orders (I had an advertisement in the local newspapers, and yes, there were no cellphones). At 17 years old I went to the University and started my career in Computer Engineering, then two years later, I dropped off, and I change my career studies to follow a woman that I was in love (yeap!, like the emoji of the guy hitting his forehead with the open hand) I shifted to Industrial Engineering and got my degree (for me was not possible to make both careers at the same time). Years pass, and I have been working in different manufacturing companies as a supervisor and engineer the highest title I got in the computer was to be the IT guy of my familyâ€¦ repairing computers to aunts, cousins, friends, coworkers, etc. 

In 2013 I moved to San Jose, CA, due to a job offer I got from the company for a better position. When I was driving through Silicon Valley, that young passioned kid for computers got alive again. I started visiting all the tech companies. I saw what I wanted to be all my life. So, I tried to jump on it, but between my job responsibilities and divorce and lack of time management, I had to postpone boot camps and programming curses over and over. I was frustrated until one time I saw an ad on Instagram of the app Career Karma and subscribed and took the 21 days challenge they have witch it's exciting how they help you to merge into the tech world. I finished my 21-day trial in 34 days (the job responsibilities and my lack of time management were killing me), but I finished anyway and starred having the feeling of what matters for me and I did it struggling. But I was still not happy at my job; I was stuck. I prayed all days and gave everything to GOD and trust Him with my life and soul that He will find the best for me. Then one regular morning, I went to work, and they were cutting personal, and HR offers me the possibility of accepting an early retirement package, and I said yes!! With a smile, I could not cover. 

Its time, I'm ready to follow my always dream. I said Thank you, GOD!! Thank you, thank you!... I applied to eight different boot camps and got accepted in 7. Not a natural choice, so I start doing my research to find the best fit for me with the combination of the best boot camp reviews and experiences, so I decide with a big smile on my face to go with Flatiron School, and I happily got accepted. 

I'm happy, and I have been enjoying this moment of making one of the best decisions of my life! I know I have a robust and hard journey coming in the next 11 months, but the next year I will be a Software Engineer, and I will be able to contribute the society with passion ðŸ˜Š.
