Hi, Im Pedro, me at 10 years old living in Venezuela sitting down in front of an IBM computer for the very first time started  "playing" with MS-DOS, creating directories, copy and delete files, fun stuff‚Ä¶ a few years later my father got another computer with Windows NT. I got amaze with the display of the windows and the color of the executable‚Äôs files (paintbrush, sound recorder, solitary, mines, word, excel, etc.).  

Also of course I started playing video games that came in 5.25‚Äù floppy disk at first and them 3.5‚Äù floppy disk, I enjoyed the installation process and I was very curious of how the programs were build and how was the communication between hardware and software (programing)‚Ä¶ My first favorites video games were Prince of Persia, Maniac Mansion, Leisure Suit Larry, Digger, Sim city, Test Drive, the secret of Monkey Island and the list can go until todays date GTAV‚Ä¶ 
I always liked to open and took apart the computers and reassembled again. 

At my 15th I used to make ‚Äúclones PC‚Äù and sold it by phone request pickup orders (I had an advertisement in the local newspapers and yes there were no cellphones). This passion gets me into start my studies of Computer Science Engineer at 17 years old in the university‚Ä¶ two years later I dropped off Computer Science and I change my career studies just to follow a woman that I was in love‚Ä¶ (yeap!,  I‚Äôm like the emoji of the guy hitting his forehead with the open hand)‚Ä¶ I shifted to Industrial Engineering and got my degree‚Ä¶ (for me was not possible to do both careers at the same time). 

Years pass and I have been working in different manufacturing companies as a supervisor and engineer‚Ä¶ the highest title I got in computer was to be the IT guy of my family‚Ä¶ repairing computers to aunts, cousins, friends, coworkers, etc. 

In 2013 I moved to San Jose CA, due to a job offer I got from the company for a better position‚Ä¶ I was already disconnected of computer science updates and news, etc.‚Ä¶ then when I was driving through San Jose downtown, Cupertino, Mounting View, Palo Alto, San Francisco‚Ä¶ that young passioned kid for computers got alive again, visiting all the tech companies‚Äô tours. I saw what I wanted to be all my life‚Ä¶ So I wanted to jump on it again but between my job responsibilities, divorce had me to postpone bootcamps and programing curses over and over‚Ä¶ 

I was really frustrated, until one time I saw an ad on Instagram of the app Career Karma and subscribe and took the 21 days challenge they have witch its very interesting how they help you to merge into the tech world‚Ä¶ I finished my 21-day challenge in 34 days (the job responsibilities and my lack of time management were killing me), but I finished anyway and star having the felling of what really matter for me and I did it struggling‚Ä¶ But I was still not happy at my job I was stuck‚Ä¶

I prayed all days and gave everything to GOD and trust Him with my life and soul that He will find the best for me. One morning I went to work, and they were cutting personal and HR offer me the possibility if I wanted to of accepting an early retirement package and I said yes!! With a smile I could not cover. 

This is the moment to follow my always dream‚Ä¶ I said Thank you GOD!! Thank you thank you!... I applied to an 8 different bootcamps and got accepted in 7. Not an easy choice so I start doing my research to find the best fit for me with the combination of the best bootcamp reviews and experiences, so I decide with a big smile on my face to go with Flatiron School‚Ä¶ and I happily got accepted. 

I‚Äôm happy and I have been enjoying this moment of making one of the best decisions of my life! I know have a tough and hard journey coming in the next 11 months but the next year I will be a Software Engineer and I will be able to contribute the society with passion‚Ä¶ üòä.
